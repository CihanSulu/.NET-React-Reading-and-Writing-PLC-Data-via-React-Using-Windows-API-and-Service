# .NET React Reading And Writing PLC Data Via React Using Windows API And Service

🚀 Project Overview 🌟

In this project, PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) are used for real-time monitoring in factories. These specialized computers control manufacturing lines, machinery, and various processes. Unlike general-purpose computers, PLCs are designed to have multiple inputs and outputs, making them more resilient to electrical noise, temperature fluctuations, mechanical shocks, and vibrations. 💻⚙️

📊🔧Real-Time Monitoring with .NET API: Through a .NET API, PLCs in factories are monitored in real time. If any changes or errors occur at any factory station, the system records this data in an SQL database. With a React interface, users can track, modify, or insert changes efficiently. 

⚡💡Industry Demand: This solution addresses a significant need in the industry. While similar projects have been developed using .NET Forms, this is the first PLC monitoring software in Turkey to be developed using React and APIs. It’s optimized for high speed and performance, offering advanced features and flexibility. 

🏭📍In Use in Factories: Currently in active use at factories in the Izmir region, this software is crucial for the companies employing it, ensuring smooth operations and efficient monitoring.
